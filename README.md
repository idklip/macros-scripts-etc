mouseloc.py includes a script from https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mouse.html that I optimizied for my personal use, adjusing mouse true location to the resolution of my monitor and my personal
double rounding function that I included so there was no need to import.



gptAuto.py was an auto sort script that I created. I used AI to optimize batch processing and non-recursive capabilities to ensure speed and efficieny.
